# Introduction

    In my 5 hours of creating a working folder, installing libraries, running a server, building a simple website, and pushing the repo into github, I have encountered only a few challenges mainly because the files sent to the Google Classroom made this task 100x easier and I only encountered them by accident.

## Installing Libraries

    Sometime during this process, I encountered a problem where the virtual environment couldn't start because running scripts was disabled, but thankfully, there was a file that includes instructions on how to allow scripts to execute.

## Pushing the repository to Github

    This is where I spend most of my time in while doing the assignment. Why? Because I accidentally pushed it without adding the     
    .gitignore file. So I deleted the repository and created it again with the same name as before. Then, I pushed it again, this time I included the .gitignore file. It worked. But then I noticed the previous files were still there, including the files that should've not been pushed because of the .gitignore file, even though I deleted the whole repository. After some long time digging through the internet looking for solutions, I managed to push it properly, without including the files listed in the .gitignore file.
